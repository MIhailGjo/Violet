Violet Task Manager is a simple concept productivity app that makes jotting down notes and organizing calendar tasks quick and straightforward. It’s built primarily in Swift with SwiftUI and utilizes Firebase for login and data synchronization.

The app keeps things simple with a clean interface and a single key feature called TouchNow. Just open it and type whatever’s on your mind a task, a reminder, or a random thought. Violet looks at what you wrote and suggests whether it belongs on your calendar, in your notes, or somewhere else. You can come back later to add details like dates, times, or formatting.

Violet is designed to be fast and easy to pick up, without the steep learning curve that many productivity tools have, but still flexible enough to handle a wide range of tasks.
